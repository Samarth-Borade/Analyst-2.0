Core Prompt Intelligence
Conversational Context Memory - Keep chat history so users can ask follow-up questions like "show me the same data but by region" without re-explaining
Multi-step Query Chains - Support "First show me top 5 products, then break down their sales by month" in one prompt
Suggested Next Questions - AI-generated follow-up suggestions based on current data view
Natural Language Explanations - Auto-generate insights/summaries of what the data shows
Advanced Data Capabilities
Data Transformation in UI - Let users clean, pivot, aggregate data through prompts ("remove nulls", "combine these columns")
Smart Data Type Detection - Auto-detect and suggest column types, allow overrides
Multi-source Joins - "Join sales data with customer data on ID" - support complex queries across tables


Real-time Data Connectors - Go beyond CSV: SQL databases, APIs, Google Sheets, Salesforce, etc.


Visualization Enhancements
Drill-Down Navigation - Click a bar to see the underlying details (click 2024 → see monthly breakdown)
Cross-Chart Filtering - Select a customer in one chart and auto-filter all others
Custom Styling per Dashboard - Color schemes, fonts, layouts via simple prompts
Dashboard Templates - Pre-built layouts users can clone and customize

Collaboration & Sharing
Share Dashboards - With granular permissions (view-only, edit, admin)
Real-time Collaboration - Multiple users editing same dashboard simultaneously
Audit Logs - Track who changed what and when


Smart Analytics
AI-Powered Insights - Auto-detect anomalies, trends, correlations
Forecasting - "Predict next quarter sales" based on historical data
What-if Scenarios - "Show me sales if we increase price by 10%"
Performance & Polish
Smart Caching - Cache common queries to speed up dashboard loads
Pagination for Large Datasets - Handle millions of rows efficiently
Mobile-First Design - Full functionality on tablets/phones
Dark Mode & Accessibility - WCAG compliance
The biggest differentiator vs Power BI/Tableau would be making the prompt interface truly conversational—where users naturally explore data through dialogue rather than clicking through menus.
