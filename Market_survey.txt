What is the market problem, pain or unmet need you are solving?
0 / 300 words
Executives and business leaders spend countless hours struggling with complex BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker—tools designed for data analysts, not decision-makers. According to Accenture, the average executive wastes 2-3 hours weekly just trying to extract insights from dashboards they can't easily modify. Traditional analytics platforms require technical expertise, SQL knowledge, or dedicated analyst support for even simple queries. This creates a costly bottleneck: decisions are delayed, opportunities are missed, and expensive analyst time is consumed answering basic questions. Small and mid-sized businesses often lack dedicated data teams entirely, leaving executives data-blind. Furthermore, a Dresner Advisory Services survey found that 67% of SME executives report dissatisfaction with current analytics tools due to steep learning curves and inflexible interfaces. The gap between data availability and data accessibility continues to widen as businesses generate more information than ever. DashExai solves this by enabling anyone to interact with their data through natural language prompts—no coding, no complex interfaces, just ask and receive actionable visualizations instantly.
